# Privacy Policy

We use this app to connect n8n automation workflows with Intuit QuickBooks Online.

Data accessed from QuickBooks depends on the permissions authorized via Intuit OAuth, and may include vendors, customers, invoices, bills, payments, expenses, and company/account metadata.

We use the data only to perform the authorized automation tasks. We do not sell personal data.

OAuth tokens may be stored securely to maintain the connection. Access can be revoked by disconnecting the app in Intuit settings.
